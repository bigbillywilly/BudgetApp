# Family Budget Helper

A modern web application designed to simplify family budget management through automated expense tracking and AI-powered financial insights.

## What is Family Budget Helper?

Family Budget Helper is a full-stack web application that transforms how families manage their finances. Instead of spending hours manually categorizing expenses and updating spreadsheets, families can simply upload their bank statements and receive instant, intelligent analysis of their spending patterns.

## Motivation

I built this application for my cousin and family who were frustrated with their time-consuming budgeting process. Every month, they spent 2+ hours manually entering transactions from bank statements, categorizing each expense by hand, creating budget reports in spreadsheets, and trying to identify spending patterns and opportunities for savings.

Watching them struggle with this tedious process motivated me to create a solution that would automate these tasks and provide intelligent insights they couldn't get from spreadsheets alone.

## Problem Solved

**The Problem:** Traditional budgeting methods are time-consuming and provide limited insights.

**The Solution:** Family Budget Helper automates the heavy lifting of budget management:

- **CSV Import:** Upload bank statements and automatically categorize transactions
- **AI Insights:** Ask natural language questions like "Where can we save money this month?"
- **Smart Categorization:** Machine learning automatically sorts expenses into budget categories
- **Mobile Access:** Check budget status anywhere, anytime
- **Real-time Analysis:** Instant spending pattern recognition and recommendations

**Impact:** Reduces weekly budget maintenance from 2 hours to 15 minutes while providing deeper financial insights.

## Why These Technologies?

### Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite

- **React:** Component-based architecture makes the UI maintainable and scalable
- **TypeScript:** Prevents bugs and improves development experience with type safety
- **Vite:** Lightning-fast development server and optimized builds

### Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript

- **Node.js:** Enables full-stack JavaScript development and easy CSV processing
- **Express:** Lightweight, flexible framework perfect for REST APIs
- **TypeScript:** Consistent type safety across frontend and backend

### Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma

- **PostgreSQL:** Reliable, ACID-compliant database perfect for financial data
- **Prisma:** Type-safe database access with excellent TypeScript integration

### AI Integration: OpenAI API

- **GPT-4:** Provides natural language processing for financial insights and recommendations
- **Context-aware:** Understands family spending patterns to give personalized advice

### Additional Tools

- **Tailwind CSS:** Rapid UI development with consistent design
- **Zustand:** Lightweight state management for React
- **Docker:** Consistent development environment across machines
